# python-miniexercises
This is a carpet where I keep some of the mini exercises that I've done during my college introductory Python class. 
They are really simple and so are my answers, but they are cute and done with love. Please treat them well :)

### API
It consists in creating a Pokemon statistic searching engine using this API: https://pokeapi.co/

### rock_paper_scissors
The title is too obvious to give another explanation. By the way, I have used if/else conditions and lists to create the game. 

### hangman
Again, the title is too obvious. The program is designed to randomly choose a word between:*"badbunny","pepe", "shakira", "gerardpiqué", "illojuan", "quevedo" and "badgyal"* for users to guess.


Finally, I want to shout out to Gaël for teaching my Python, idk if you will see this but you are my favorite lecturer from that school <3
