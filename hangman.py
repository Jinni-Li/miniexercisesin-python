# HANGMAN

#Step 1:
# TODO-1 - create a words list
# TODO-2 - Randomly choose a word from the word_list and assign it to a variable called chosen_word.
# TODO-3 - Ask the user to guess a letter and assign their answer to a variable called guess. Make guess lowercase.
# TODO-4 - Check if the letter the user guessed (guess) is one of the letters in the chosen_word.

#Step 2:

#TODO-1: - Create an empty List called display.
#For each letter in the chosen_word, add a "_" to 'display'.
#So if the chosen_word was "apple", display should be ["_", "_", "_", "_", "_"] with 5 "_" representing each letter to guess.

#TODO-2: - Loop through each position in the chosen_word;
#If the letter at that position matches 'guess' then reveal that letter in the display at that position.
#e.g. If the user guessed "p" and the chosen word was "apple", then display should be ["_", "p", "p", "_", "_"].
#to find the position of the letter

#TODO-3: - Print 'display' and you should see the guessed letter in the correct position and every other letter replace with "_".
#Hint - Don't worry about getting the user to guess the next letter. We'll tackle that in step 3.

######    ############   ##############   ######
#Step 3:

#TODO-1: - Use a while loop to let the user guess again. The loop should only stop once the user has guessed all the letters in the chosen_word and 'display' has no more blanks ("_"). Then you can tell the user they've won.

#TODO-1: - Create a variable called 'lives' to keep track of the number of lives left.
